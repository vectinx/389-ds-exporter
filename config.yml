# The 'global' section defines general exporter parameters.
global:
  # List of LDAP entries for which information about the number of subrecords (numsubordinates) will be collected.
  #
  # ds_numsubordinate_records: []

  # The maximum duration the server will wait for a graceful shutdown of all resources when the application is stopping.
  # During this period, the server stops accepting new connections, attempts to finish processing ongoing requests,
  # and properly closes the HTTP server, LDAP connection pools, and other active resources.
  # If the timeout is exceeded, any remaining open connections or resources will be forcibly closed to prevent the application from hanging.
  # If the value is 0, it is assumed that the timeout has already expired and graceful shutdown will be skipped.
  #
  # shutdown_timeout: 5

# The 'http' section defines the parameters of the HTTP server that provides metrics.
http:
  # The address and port on which the server will listen for incoming connections.
  # Use the format <host>:<port>. For example:
  # ":9389" will listen on port 9389 on all network interfaces.
  # "0.0.0.0:9389" will listen on port 9389 on all IPv4 interfaces.
  # "192.168.0.10:9389" will listen on port 9389 only on 192.168.0.10.
  #
  # listen_address: "127.0.0.1:9389"

  # HTTP endpoint where metrics are exposed.
  #
  # metrics_path: "/metrics"

  # Maximum duration allowed for reading the entire request, including the body.
  # A zero or negative value means no timeout.
  #
  # read_timeout: 10

  # Maximum duration before timing out writes of the response.
  # This timeout is reset whenever a new requestâ€™s header is read.
  # A zero or negative value means no timeout.
  #
  # write_timeout: 15

  # Maximum duration to wait for the next request when keep-alives are enabled.
  # If zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used.
  # If negative, or if both this and ReadTimeout are zero or negative, there is no timeout.
  #
  # idle_timeout: 60

  # Maximum duration to wait for the client to send the beginning of the request after a connection is accepted.
  # If the client doesn't send any data within this time, the connection will be closed.
  # A value of 0 disables the timeout, meaning the server will wait indefinitely.
  #
  # initial_read_timeout: 3

# The 'ldap' section defines the parameters of the connection to the LDAP server.
ldap:
  # LDAP server URL in RFC-2255 format. For example:
  # "ldap://localhost:389" or "ldaps://remote-server"
  #
  server_url: "ldap://localhost:389"

  # DN of the account used to authenticate with the LDAP server.
  #
  bind_dn: "cn=directory manager"

  # Password of the LDAP account.
  #
  bind_pw: "12345678"

  # Maximum size of the LDAP connection pool.
  # Recommended and default value is 4. If set lower, metric collectors may block waiting for connections, slowing down the exporter.
  # Values above 4 have no effect, as the current version of the exporter does not use more than 4 connections at once.
  #
  # pool_conn_limit: 4

# The 'log' section defines logging parameters.
log:
  # Logging level.
  # Can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, or ERROR.
  #
  # level: INFO

  # Log output target.
  # Options:
  # 'stdout' - logs are printed to standard output
  # 'file'   - logs are written to a file
  # 'both'   - logs are written to both stdout and a file
  #
  handler: stdout

  # Log file path.
  # Only relevant if 'handler' is set to 'file' or 'both'.
  # Make sure the system is configured to rotate this file (e.g., using logrotate).
  #
  # file: /var/log/389-ds-exporter/exporter.log

  # STDOUT log format.
  # Options: text, json
  # The 'text' format is the default and is convenient for syslog.
  # The 'json' format is useful for parsing logs or sending to external systems.
  # Only applies if 'handler' is 'stdout' or 'both'.
  #
  # stdout_format: text

  # File log format.
  # Options: text, json
  # Applies only if 'handler' is 'file' or 'both'.
  #
  # file_format: json
